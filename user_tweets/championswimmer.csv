a) is not harmful, it's just a contact in your book
b) doesn't mean your mobile gets connected to Aadhaar or anything 

Only it is irritating that Govt pushes UIDAI as if it is an emergency helpline."
"@CulerOver9000 I just tested four, Sony didn't have, other three I named had it.  More might have..."
"@kingslyj So there's a provisioning step when device is first used to get the localised emergency numbers. If my hunch is right, GoI is abusing that channel. Technically this information is provided by the country's Govt and Google/Apple would be trusting it."
"Other ways it 100% is there - 
On Samsung, Xiaomi and Micromax phones I find this exists *before* Internet hits.  So YES,  PRELOADED by OEMs into the device. Cannot confirm other OEMs but such deals with Govt might exist."
".@kingslyj I think you can confirm, this doesn't exist before first Internet access."
"Conditions that lead to this - 
1. Possibly Indian IP address? 
2. Even without Indian IP (used a VPN) if I select English (India) as language it still fetches the number."
@kingslyj Doing that please follow the thread. Am digging this over today and tomorrow
"The no does not exist on a fresh install before the device connects to the Internet.  So it is coming from the Internet, and not present in the OS itself.  
Also without the proprietary Google Apps it still gets this number."
"I would like to list cases what 100% without doubt can get you the UIDAI contact. 
1. Airtel and Vodafone (not checked others) have this as a SIM contact. 
2. Installing a few Govt apps, including the UIDAI, and giving them Contacts access also adds this no"
"While I do not 'literally' know Android source inside out (no one can) and I don't build AOSP *every* day. I do happen to build it pretty frequently, and the Contacts and ContactsProvider are codebases I have a lot of interest in and intricately familar with. So I dug deeper."
